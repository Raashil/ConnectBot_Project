# ðŸ“§ ConnectWise: AI-Powered Cold Email Generation

ConnectWise is an innovative application that automates the generation of personalized cold emails for software service companies. By leveraging web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), and vector databases, ConnectWise streamlines the process of identifying potential clients, analyzing their needs, and crafting compelling outreach messages.

## Features

* **Automated Job Extraction:** Extracts relevant job postings from a target company's career page using web scraping and an LLM.
* **Intelligent Skill Matching:**  Analyzes job descriptions to identify key skills and requirements, then queries a vector database to find the most relevant portfolio examples.
* **Personalized Email Generation:**  Generates tailored cold emails that incorporate job-specific details and showcase the service provider's expertise through relevant portfolio links.
* **Streamlit UI:**  Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting target URLs and visualizing the generated emails.

## How it Works

1. **Input:** The user provides the URL of a company's career page.
2. **Data Acquisition:** ConnectWise fetches the page content using `WebBaseLoader`.
3. **Preprocessing:** The raw HTML is cleaned using the `clean_text` function.
4. **Job Extraction:** An LLM extracts job postings and their details (role, skills, etc.).
5. **Skill Matching:** The extracted skills are used to query a ChromaDB vector database containing the service provider's portfolio information.
6. **Email Generation:** The LLM generates personalized cold emails, dynamically incorporating relevant portfolio links.
7. **Output:** The generated emails are displayed in the Streamlit app.

## Technologies Used

* **Groq:** Provides the large language model (LLM) for text understanding and generation.
* **LangChain:**  Framework for integrating and managing the LLM.
* **Streamlit:**  Framework for building the user interface.
* **ChromaDB:**  Vector database for storing and querying portfolio information.
* **Pandas:**  Library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Python:**  Programming language for the entire project.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ConnectWise.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Obtain a Groq API key:**  Sign up for an account at [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) and create an API key.
4. **Set environment variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `app` directory and add your Groq API key:

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Run the Streamlit app:** `streamlit run app/main.py`
